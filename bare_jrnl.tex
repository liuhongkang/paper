% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf

% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%

  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Existing methods for infrared small target detection are not effective under highly complex backgrounds condition. It is mainly caused by: (1) the interference of strong edges and other similar-target components. (2) not making full use of the context information of background and target in spatio-temporal domain. Inspired by this, we form a spatio-temporal cube with current image patch and adjacent image patches in spatio-temporal adjacent domain, then we establish a spatio-temporal tensor model for small target detection. According to the sparse prior of target and the local correlation of background, the target-background separation problem is transformed into a low rank-sparse tensor decomposition problem. The target image is reconstructed from the sparse tensor obtained after tensor decomposition. The experiment results show that our method could make full use of the context information in spatio-temporal domain in infrared video. Compared with other methods, our method has better detection performance in several videos with highly complex backgrounds.

\IEEEPARstart{A}{t} present, infrared target detection technology has been widely used in missile tracking, precision guidance, early warning, maritime surveillance, ground monitoring\cite{luo2015space,dawson2010space,li2014infrared}, etc. Compared with ordinary detection tasks, lacking of sufficient information to determine the target is the main challenge of small target detection in infrared image. Due to the long infrared imaging distance, the size of small targets in infrared image is very small, generally ranging from $2\times2$ to $9\times9$ pixels\cite{wang2017infrared}. And in the case of long imaging distance, the small targets in infrared image has no fixed shape and stable texture features. In addition, the infrared radiation of targets is heavily attenuated after long-distance propagation, which results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for small infrared targets\cite{li2016novel}. When there are complex background clutter and noise, small targets with low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) are usually buried in background. Therefore, the detection of small targets under a complex infrared background is remaining a problem that is full of difficulty and challenges.

Compared with visible image, infrared image look simpler. However, infrared image lacks color information and texture information, and has poor image quality usually, which cause great difficulty in the process of small target detection.The lack of color information will result in fewer features for distinguishing between target and background. The lack of texture information and shape information means that the target cannot be distinguished based on the feature learning of the small target. Therefore, utilizing not only the relationship between small target and background, but also the motion characteristics of target is an important way to detect infrared small targets.

The small target detection methods in infrared image are mainly divided into two categories: single-frame image detection methods which use spatial domain information and spatio-temporal detection methods which utilize inter-frame temporal domain information and intra-frame spatial domain information\cite{li2016novel}. There are often some special backgrounds, such as man-made objects and cloud patch, which will interfere with the target detection task, and the imaging resolution and SCR of small target are smaller than expected. Therefore, it is impossible to identify target by using only the information in spatial domain, and the small target on a single image is invisible in perception. According to above analysis, it is extremely important to make full use of the context information of small target in the temporal domain. The current spatio-temporal detection methods usually calculate the local contrast of spatial domain and temporal domain separately, and combines them to detect the small target. However only calculating of local contrast will not identify true small targets in the case of complex noise or the motion of background, resulting in excessive false alarms and missing alarms. In order to make full use of the effective information of temporal domain and spatial domain, and to avoid the influence of noise when detecting, we propose a method for small target detection based on spatio-temporal image patch tensor decomposition. The main contribution of this paper is as follows: The proposed spatio-temporal tensor model considers the local correlation of the background image patch in spatial and temporal neighborhood domain, so it will suppress the background clutter better. And our method not only reflects the spatial significance of target, but also make full use of the motion characteristics of small target, utilizing the sparse characteristics of small target in spatio-temporal neighborhood domain.

The remaining chapters of this paper are organized as follows: We introduce the related researches of infrared small target detection in section \Rmnum{2}; And in section \Rmnum{3} we propose the spatio-temporal tensor model and the method for detecting infrared small targets via spatio-temporal image patch tensor model in detail; In section \Rmnum{4},we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method via a large number of experiments; In section \Rmnum{5}, we give the conclusions and prospects for future.


\section{Related Work}
At present, the methods proposed for detecting small moving targets in infrared video can roughly classified into two categories. The first major category is mainly performing target detection on a single image frame. The methods for target detection via single image frame are further divided into two types, which are based on the following two assumptions. The first type of methods are based on a classic assumption that background changes slowly in infrared images and high correlations exist between adjacent pixels. Another type of methods based on single image frame utilize the non-local self-correlation between background pathes in infrared image. It is usually assumed that all background image patches in infrared image are from a low-rank subspace or a mixed set composed with multiple low-rank subspaces\cite{liu2013robust}.

Based on the first hypothesis, some classical methods based on image filtering are proposed, such as two-dimensional minimum mean square error filtering\cite{hadhoud1988two}, maximum median and maximum mean filtering\cite{deshpande1999max}, transform domain methods \cite{davidson2002wavelet,peng2004dim} and so on. This type of methods enhance small targets by calculating the difference between original image and predicted background. Other methods have been proposed with extensive research in human visual system, such as Laplacian Gaussian (LoG) filter based methods\cite{kim2009small}, Gaussian difference (DoG)\cite{wang2012infrared} and second-order directional derivatives\cite{qi2013robust}. Although this type of methods can reduce the influence of edge compared with traditional method, it can not suppress the clutter and strong edges in complex background, resulting in many false alarms. Meanwhile, there is usually a large difference between infrared small target and surrounding background, based on which some methods based on local contrast are proposed, such as local contrast measurement method (LCM)\cite{chen2014local}, improved local contrast measurement (ILCM)\cite{han2014robust}, image block based multi-scale contrast measurement (MPCM)\cite{wei2016multiscale} and so on. Similarly, other methods such as local difference measurement (LDM)\cite{deng2017entropy}, local significance map (LSM)\cite{chen2016efficient} and weighted local difference measure (WLDM)\cite{deng2016small} have been proposed in succession. This traditional type of methods can suppress background and enhance small targets, but a large amount of noise and clutters are also enhanced in the case of complex background, and are considered as small targets by mistake. So the false-alarm rate of these methods are usually high and the practicability is reduced also.

Based on the second hypothesis, small target detection in infrared image can be transformed into a low-rank matrix recovery problem. Gao\cite{gao2013infrared} et al. proposed to convert the traditional infrared image model into a new infrared image patch model, and considered that background has low rank characteristics and the small targets are sparse relative to the whole image. Therefore target could be separeated from background via recovering low-rank and sparse matrices. However, the method still has insufficient effect when processing strong edges and clutters, so RIPT\cite{dai2017reweighted} extract prior features via local structure information , and then suppress edges with local structure weight in the process of small target detection.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


\appendices
\section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
\section{}
Appendix two text goes here.


% use section* for acknowledgment

% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference

% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:

% can use a bibliography generated by BibTeX as a .bbl file
% BibTeX documentation can be easily obtained at:

% biography section
% 
% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

\begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
Biography text here.
\end{IEEEbiography}

% if you will not have a photo at all:
\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
Biography text here.
\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Jane Doe}
Biography text here.
\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
%\enlargethispage{-5in}
